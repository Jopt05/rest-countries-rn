Test this app on your phone! Sadly I don't have a Google Developer Account yet, so I uploaded it to Google Drive until I have enough money to upload it.

Download the APK [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1D_bKlzBc3KxjCMQoanGOhc97XZ1QGhXV).

# Set up development

  

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

  

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

  

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

  

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

  

```bash

# using npm

npm  start

  

# OR using Yarn

yarn  start

```

  

## Step 2: Start your Application

  

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

  

### For Android

  

```bash

# using npm

npm  run  android

  

# OR using Yarn

yarn  android

```

  

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
